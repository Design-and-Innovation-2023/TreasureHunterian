The narrow cobblestone streets were lined with charming cottages adorned with colorful flower boxes, and the air carried the sweet scent of freshly baked bread from the local bakery. Everbrook was a place where neighbors knew each other by name, and the sense of community was palpable.',

		bio: "Hello, I am Jun Xiang, currently a Sophomore in SIT-UoG pursuing Bachelorâ€™s in Computing Science. As the Tech Expert for this Design Project, I contribute to the overall development. Special thanks to Professor Jonathan Grizou for being the beam of light in this module and his guidance have expanded my world view a lot. This has helped me to refine my critical and design thinking skills to tackle issues that the team face. With Ruth Fletcher as the client, she has given a lot of support to understand the local culture and given a clear view of the project requirements. Doing such project in a different cultural context has definitely challenged and gave me more confidence in my own skills. I am proud of my team member and also the project that we have come up with. I am excited to apply the new refined skills in my future endeavours. P.S: I'm also the cameraman for the team!",
